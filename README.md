# Introduction
In "Hunted Hunter," player immerse themselves in a 2D platformer set within a dense forest. As the protagonist, player must navigate through the wilderness while contending with various challenges. Among these challenges are aggressive wolves that leap to attack and eagles that descend from the sky. To survive, players can strategically deploy kunai to eliminate threats. Additionally, players can utilize environmental elements such as rocks for defence against wolves and trees for cover from eagle assaults.
